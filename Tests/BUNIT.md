# BUnit

- Blazor components:
    - Are rendered
    - Have life cycle during which we can provide input to them
    - Can produce output

- Use bUnit (TestContext) to:
    - Render the component under test
    - Pass in its parameters
    - Inject required services
    - Access the rendered component instance and the markup it has produced




- Testing styles
- Component under test
- Verification strategies:
    - Verify rendered markup
    - Verify event callbacks
    - Inspect component instance
    - Capture thrown exceptions
